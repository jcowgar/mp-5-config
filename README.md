Jeremy's Minimum Profile Configuration Files
============================================

Minimum Profile is a cross-platform GUI or Text based programmers file editor.
Included is MPSL, a scripting language built for extending and configuring
the editor. Thus, many things can be done with it.

These are my config files for it.
